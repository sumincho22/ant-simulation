# Ant Simulation
### Description
* This application is designed to mimic how ants find food sources and make grouped paths from their colonies.
  Initially, ants wander around, in search of a food source. After the ants find a food source, they follow their paths
  back to their colonies. Then, they take the best possible path back to the food source to get more food. The food
  sources decrease in size as the ants pick up food, and, once the food source is depleted, the ants disperse and wander
  once again.
