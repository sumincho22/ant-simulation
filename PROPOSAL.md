For my final project, I will be creating an ant simulation. There will be a colony, where the ants are initially
released from. Then, they will make their own paths to travel to a nearby food source. When they find food, they carry
it and leave marks as they trail back to their colonies.

In terms of ants, I know that ants normally move in unpredictable, random paths, and they also like to cluster
together when they travel. In terms of coding, I understand how I can make objects on the screen to move, as we have
worked with Cinder for the Ideal Gas project previously. I am motivated to do this project because I want to see how I
can artificially simulate an intricate, natural phenomenon. Moreover, the mixture of random path algorithms and
clustered, path-following nature of ants traveling will also create interesting paths. Therefore, it will be visually
appealing to observe.

* Timeline:
    * **First week**: I will have implemented the movement algorithm for the ants.
    * **Second week**: I will have implemented the ants' colony and the ants' ability to pick up food from a food source
      and bring it back.
    * **Third week**:  I will have randomized the placement of food sources and optimized for bigger population of ants
      and larger spaces.

* Stretch goals:
    * Make it so that it's playable through a website
    * Add predators/food competitors
    * Implement different colonies
